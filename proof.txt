Proof of Wilson’s theorem by Rowan and Thomas

Statement: 
 Prove that for any prime N, (n – 1)! modulo N is equal to n-1, and is not equal to N-1, if n is composite.

Proof if N is composite:
If N is not a square number, then it will have two different factors, both smaller than itself. These numbers will be contained in the multiplication of all of the numbers between 1 and N-1. Because this is a multiple of N, it will be 0 modulo N.
If N is a square: If N is 4, then we can see that 6 (3!) modulo 4 is 2, which is not 4 -1. If it is greater than 4, then it will have two things in the factorial list, one of which is the square root of the number, and one of which is the square root of the number times 2. These two will multiply to 2 × N, which is a multiple of N, meaning that (n – 1)! is a multiple of N, and will be 0 modulo N.
Proof if N is prime:
We can split (n -1)! into n-3 groups, from 2 to n-2. Now, (N – 1) * 1 modulo N is clearly N – 1. Now any modulus of N, multiplied by 1 modulo N will always be N-1. So now all we need to prove is that the multiple of all the numbers from 2 to N-2 is 1 modulo N.
If N is 2, the proof is obvious. As 1! Is 1, and 1 modulo 2 is 2 -1. So, assume N >= 3.
This means that N-1 is even, so there are an even number of values from 2 to N-2.
Because N is prime, all values less than N are coprime to N. Now for all values a, there must be some value b such that ab is 1 modulo N. Because every different value of b will have a different value modulo N, there will be 1 value that is less than or equal to N which is  1 modulo N. For each value, we can map the value out, as shown below.

2 (6), 3 (4), 4 (3), 5(9), 6(2), 7(8), 8(9), 9(5)
(2 × 6) is 1 modulo 11. (3 × 4) is 1 modulo 11. (7 × 8) is 1 modulo 11.

Now we need to prove 2 things.
1.	No two numbers will want the same b, as it can only be used once.
2.	No numbers will want themselves.
Proof of 1: If a × x is 1 modulo N, and b × x is 1 modulo N, then the difference in a and b multiplied by x must be 0 modulo N. Because a and b are both less than N-1, they can’t be a multiple of N. The same is true for x, due to our previous statement than x < N. Now if these two are not multiples of N, then they can’t multiply together to N, as N is a prime.
Proof of 2: The only values of a, such that a × a is 1 modulo N is 1, and N-1, as 1 × 1 is clearly 1, as any square number a × a minus 1 can be represented as (a – 1) × (a + 1). Which is clearly not prime, (unless a is 2). This is impossible, as we know that N is a prime, and 1 more than N minus 1 is N, which has to be a prime.

Because we can prove these two things, then all of the pairs will multiply to 1 modulo N, and 1 multiplied with N -1, will be N-1. N-1 × 1 is clearly N-1. Therefore, all prime values of N, such that (N – 1)! modulo N will be N-1.
